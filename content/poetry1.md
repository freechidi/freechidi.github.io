# Walking

from one step to another   
my mind jumps jolts as fireflies  
electric shots like lightning bolts  
and butter through my stomach fly  

and then my music speaks to me  
it takes my hand and picks me up  
as tenderly and heavy handed  
as love that shakes and wakes you up  

a love you knew was always there  
an overwhelming love for life  
a love as warm as at first sight  
you see the first love of your life  

then i  

see standing in the doorway there  
the step that takes me back again  
still I will keep walking on  
so I may take that step again
